          Hello, I'm <strong>Dan</strong>.<br></br>
          <br></br>I am a mission-driven creator, optimizer, and technologist,
          excited by the idea of continuously iterating on how myself and my
          teams produce, and get things done more efficiently and effectively
          day-to-day.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I take a data-driven and user-oriented approach when faced
          with new problems. Driven by user-experience and business results, I
          thrive on teamwork and collaboration. I have a get-stuff-done
          attitude, and enthusiasm for getting my hands dirty.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          In my free time, I am passionate about fitness, meditation, art and
          culture, organizational structures, psychology, entrepreneurship, and
          the history and development of the internet.
